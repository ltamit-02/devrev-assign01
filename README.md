Code Explanation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Importing Required Libraries

import os
import requests
import json

os ‚Üí Reads environment variables (API Key).

requests ‚Üí Handles HTTP requests to send data to DevRev.

json ‚Üí Reads and processes the JSON file.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up API Details

API_URL = "https://api.devrev.ai/works.create"
API_KEY = os.getenv("DEVREV_API_KEY")  # üîπ Fetch API Key from environment variable

API_URL ‚Üí The endpoint where tickets are uploaded.

API_KEY ‚Üí API authentication key, fetched from an environment variable.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Loading the JSON File

try:
    with open("jira_mapped_export.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        tickets = json.load(file)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Error loading JSON file: {e}")
    exit()

Reads ticket data from a JSON file.

If the file is missing or corrupt, prints an error and stops execution.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Setting API Headers

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

Authorization ‚Üí Adds the API Key for authentication.

Content-Type ‚Üí Specifies that the request data is in JSON format.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Uploading Tickets

for ticket in tickets:
    try:
        response = requests.post(API_URL, json=ticket, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 201:
            print(f"‚úÖ Successfully uploaded: {ticket['title']}")
        else:
            print(f"‚ùå Failed to upload: {ticket['title']} | Error: {response.text}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Request failed for {ticket['title']}: {e}")

Loops through each ticket and sends a request to the API.

Checks if the request was successful (201) or failed.

Handles network issues using try-except.
